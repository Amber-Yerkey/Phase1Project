This project was created for my Phase 1 project for Flatiron School.

Description: Hail and well met, adventurer! This website is for creating a randomly generated character for the table top role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons. This can be used to make a character or for inspiration. You can save your generated character and recall it for your next quest!

Instructions: Mouse over the logo in order to create a blur effect. Clicking on the navigation bar will have a dropdown with links (these are not currently linked due to the project guidelines). Clicking the button at the top of the page "Excalibur!" will randomly generate a character. If you would like to save this character, you can give it a name in the form at the bottom of the page. An option for both first name and last name are listed but both are not needed. After filling in the name, you can click on the "Save" button to the right of the form. The page will refresh and the new character will be listed under this form. Click on the saved character name to bring that character back to the screen!

Completed Project Goals: 1. Fetches from public API 2. At least 3 Event listeners included: DOMContentLoaded, Mouseenter & Mouseleave: Blur Logo, Click: "Excalibur!" Button to randomize character, Submit: Submit button at the bottom to save character

Stretch Goals: JSON server that saves character and allows user to recall character after saving
